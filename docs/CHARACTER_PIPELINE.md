# Character Pipeline — AI-generated rigged mechs

The game can replace any of its 12 procedural mechs with a high-detail rigged
GLB model, while keeping the **entire existing animation and combat system**
(walk/run, 3-hit combos, heavies, blocks, knockdowns, specials, ults, victory
poses — everything). Models are retargeted at runtime via world-space rotation
offsets, so any standard humanoid rig works without hand-tuning.

## What an incoming model needs to be

- **A single humanoid character in T-pose or A-pose** (arms out / arms ~45°).
- **Rigged** (skinned to a skeleton). Mixamo-style bone names are matched
  automatically; other conventions usually work too (see aliases in
  `src/mechs/rigadapter.js`), with `boneOverrides` as an escape hatch.
- **GLB format**, facing +Z (use `yawOffset` if not).
- It does **not** need animations — the game animates it.

## Recommended workflow

1. **Canonical images** — generate with the prompt sheets in
   [`canonical-prompts.md`](canonical-prompts.md) (Midjourney / DALL-E /
   SDXL / etc.). Best results for the 3D step: full body, T-pose or neutral
   stance, front view (plus side/back views if the service accepts
   multi-view), plain background, whole character in frame.
2. **Image → 3D** — use one of:
   - **Meshy.ai** (image-to-3D + auto-rig + texture; API available)
   - **Tripo3D** (same feature set; API available)
   - Any mesh source + **Mixamo auto-rigger** (free; upload mesh, place
     markers, download rigged FBX → convert to GLB, e.g. in Blender)
   Ask the service for **T-pose rig** output when offered.
3. **Drop into the game**:
   - Put the file at `public/models/<mechId>.glb`
   - Add an entry to `public/models/manifest.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "titanus": { "url": "models/titanus.glb", "bindPose": "tpose" }
     }
     ```
   - Run the game. That mech now uses the model; everything else is untouched.
     Any mech not in the manifest keeps its procedural model, and a model that
     fails to load falls back automatically.

If you provide a **Meshy or Tripo API key**, steps 2–3 can be fully automated
from the canonical images (generation, rigging, download, manifest update).

## Manifest options

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | — | path under `public/` |
| `bindPose` | `"tpose"` | `"tpose"`, `"apose"`, `"native"` (already arms-down), or a custom `{joint:[x,y,z]}` degree map |
| `boneOverrides` | `{}` | force joint→bone mapping, e.g. `{"torso": "Spine2"}` |
| `heightScale` | `1.0` | multiply the mech's gameplay height for the visual |
| `yawOffset` | `0` | degrees, if the model doesn't face +Z |
| `emissiveBoost` | — | multiply emissive intensity (make cores/visors pop with bloom) |
| `stretch` | `{}` | lengthen limb segments, e.g. `{"elbowL": 1.2, "handL": 1.2}`: multiplies that joint's bone offset from its parent (skin follows) — for models whose proportions undershoot the mech (measure bone-chain vs `computeDims` before guessing) |

## Verifying a model

- `?glbview=<mechId>[&yaw=<deg>]` — the raw file with NO rig and neutral
  lighting: judge which way it's authored facing (the red pillar marks +Z)
  and its true bind stance before trusting in-game shots, where core/glow
  lights can make the back read as a face. Screenshot yaw 0/90/180/270.
- `?rigtest` — sanity-check the retarget math on a synthetic Mixamo-style
  skeleton (15/15 bones should map; puppet should stand arms-down and animate).
- `?battle=uptown&p1=<mechId>&p2=viper&auto=1` — watch the actual model fight.
- Checklist: arms hang naturally at rest (if not → wrong `bindPose`),
  feet on the ground (→ `heightScale`), facing its opponent (→ `yawOffset`),
  fists lead punches (if elbows bend backwards, a bone got mismapped — check
  the console warning and add `boneOverrides`).

## How the retargeting works (for maintainers)

`src/mechs/gltf.js` builds the invisible *virtual skeleton* (the same joint
rig the procedural mechs use) and parents the scaled GLB under the mech root.
`src/mechs/rigadapter.js` poses the virtual rig into the model's bind stance
(e.g. T-pose), records per-joint offsets `O = jointWorld⁻¹ · boneWorld`, then
every frame after the Animator runs sets each mapped bone (parents first) to
`local = parentWorld⁻¹ · jointWorld · O`, plus a hips-translation channel for
bobs/crouches. Convention-free: no per-axis fix-ups per rig.
