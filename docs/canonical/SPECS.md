# Canonical image specs — the visual read of all 12 concept images

The user-supplied canonical concept images are the source of truth for each
mech's look. **Commit the PNGs here as `<mechId>-front.png`** (they exist in
the design conversation; an AI session cannot save chat images itself).
Until/alongside that, this file records the detailed image-derived spec each
rebuild was built from — palettes are already baked into `roster.js` skin
recipes, geometry into `src/mechs/designs/<id>.js`. If a design ever needs
re-doing, work from the image if present, else from this spec.

Shared traits across all 12 images: full-body front view on plain gray
studio background, realistic PBR materials, panel lines, per-mech unit
decals (names/numbers/emblems), one or two emissive accent colors.

## NULLBOT — mech_null.png (The Fatal Exception)
A living system error. Read: TALL gaunt frame (legs+arms long, waist
pinched) in layered VOID-BLACK jagged shard-armor with a faint violet

eyes (0xff1f2a), spike-stacked pauldrons, crooked spine-fan mantle off the

Sternum bears the RED NULL SIGIL: a glowing ring with a blade slashed
through it (Ø). All over the shell, small rectangles of the body "fail to
render": multicolor data-corruption chips (cyan/magenta/red/green/blue)
flickering at wrong angles — in-engine these are glow2 shard plates
strobed by the animator plus glitchFleck particles off random joints.
Powers: every landed punch/backhand/bolt corrupts a PART of the victim
(glitch stack, kept all round; 10th stack = 3s total-corruption stun at
2x damage, then clears); Null Pointer (tumbling voxel-knot bolt),
SEGFAULT (de-rez dash-through), SYSTEM CRASH (corruption nova, +3 stacks),
finisher = grab, engulf in glitches, punch the CAMERA → 3s SYSTEM FAILURE
bluescreen (docs/canonical/null_bluescreen_of_death.png).
