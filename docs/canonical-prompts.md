# Canonical Character Prompt Sheets — the 12 mechs

Style-locked prompts for generating the canonical images (Midjourney, DALL-E,
SDXL, Flux, etc.). The style block keeps the whole roster coherent: MechWarrior
realism in materials and wear, Override-style heroic proportions, one strong
anime accent color per mech (the glowing core/visor that carries into the game).

## Shared style block — append to every prompt

> ultra-detailed mecha concept art, realistic PBR materials, battle-worn armor
> with chipped paint, decals, unit markings and panel lines, hard-surface
> design, heroic humanoid proportions (roughly 6.5 heads tall), full body in
> frame head to foot, standing T-pose with arms straight out, facing camera,
> plain light-gray studio background, even neutral lighting, glowing emissive
> accents, style of MechWarrior 5 and Armored Core concept art with anime
> color sensibility, 4k, sharp focus

For each mech, generate: **front view (T-pose)** — required; **side view** and
**back view** — recommended if your image→3D service accepts multi-view input;
plus one **hero action shot** (any pose, for reference/marketing only).

Practical tips: "T-pose" is sometimes ignored — "A-pose, arms slightly away
from body" also works (set `bindPose: "apose"` later). Reject images with
cropped feet, overlapping props, or busy backgrounds; those hurt the 3D step.
